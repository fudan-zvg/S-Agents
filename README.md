In open-ended settings, optimizing collaboration for efficiency and effectiveness demands flexible adjustments. Despite this, current research mainly emphasizes fixed, task-oriented workflows and overlooks agent-centric organizational structures. Drawing inspiration from human organizational behavior, we introduce a self-organizing agent system (S-Agents) with a ‚Äútree of agents‚Äù structure for dynamic workflow, an ‚Äúhourglass agent architecture‚Äù for balancing information priorities, and a ‚Äúnon-obstructive collaboration‚Äù method to allow asynchronous task execution among agents. This structure can autonomously coordinate a group of agents, efficiently addressing the challenges of an open and dynamic environment without human intervention.

### Methodology

1) A ``tree of agents" organizational structure, comprising a root node (leadership agent) and multiple leaf nodes (executor agents). The leadership agent autonomously arranges a flexible workflow without the need for human intervention.

2) An hourglass agent architecture that strives to balance priorities between the agent community and the physical environment, promoting coordinated actions.

3) A Non-obstructive collaboration approach breaks away from the constraint of multiple intelligent agents sharing a fixed convergence beat, allowing agents to asynchronously execute collaborative tasks. This method is designed to alleviate delays induced by the slowest agent in each round, thereby enhancing overall efficiency.
